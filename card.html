			<p>According to Wikipedia, the meerkat (Suricata suricatta) or suricate is a small mongoose found in southern Africa. They are active during the day, mostly in the early morning and late afternoon. Commonly found in arid, open habitats with little woody vegetation. Meerkats occur in southwestern Botswana, western and southern Namibia and northern and western South Africa. Meerkats are highly social, and form packs of two to 30 individuals.</p>
